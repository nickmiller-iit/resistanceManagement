# Resistance Management with Targeted Extinction
Inspired by the strategy of crop rotation following unextpected damage to rootworm resistant transgenic crops. The idea is that targeted elimination of resistant populations through crop rotation inposes a sort of pseudo frequency dependent selection - the more frequent resistance alleles become, they higher the chance they will be in a population that is wiped out.
